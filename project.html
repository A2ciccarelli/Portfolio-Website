            <p>
              I designed this story-driven eLearning experience to help MPI
              employees effectively use the company’s new internal AI tool, Ani,
              to retrieve information and answer questions. In this engaging,
              scenario-based module, Ani takes center stage as the main
              character, introducing herself, demonstrating her capabilities,
              and guiding learners through how she can streamline their work and
              boost efficiency.

          <h1>Summary</h1>
          <p>
            MPI Inc. launched a new internal AI tool, “Ani,” designed to answer
            questions and cite files from a curated company database. During
            testing, stakeholders found that employees struggled to get started
            and understand Ani’s benefits—despite existing video resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            After analyzing the issue, I identified a lack of interactivity and
            relatable content in the original training. To address this, I
            proposed a story-based eLearning experience where learners interact
            directly with Ani, gaining hands-on practice and a clearer
            understanding of how she can support daily tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal was to help employees across departments use Ani
            effectively and improve task efficiency and accuracy by 20%. The
            client approved the solution and moved forward with development.

          <h1>Needs Analysis</h1>
          <p>
            To kick off development, I collaborated with a Subject Matter Expert
            (SME) to gain a deeper understanding of MPI’s internal AI tool and
            the anticipated needs of employees. Together, we defined the
            project’s overall learning goal and established a way to measure
            success: a pre- and post-assessment focused on department-specific
            questions that Ani could help answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pre-assessment would be completed without AI support, while the
            post-assessment would allow learners to use Ani. By comparing
            completion times, we could demonstrate improvements in information
            retrieval efficiency. We also identified key topics about Ani that
            would be essential for employees to understand her value and
            capabilities.

          <h1>Text-based Storyboard</h1>
          <p>
            After completing the needs analysis, I developed a Design Document
            outlining goals, objectives, deliverables, milestones, and the plan
            for implementation and evaluation. With approval, I moved into
            storyboarding, scripting Ani’s narration to guide learners through
            the course with clear objectives, real-world examples, and practice
            opportunities. I collaborated closely with the SME to ensure
            accuracy and alignment with Ani’s capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            To boost engagement, I designed Ani with a conversational tone,
            applying Mayer’s Personalization Principle for relatable narration
            and the Signaling Principle through animations and visual cues. Real
            interface screenshots added context, helping learners visualize how
            Ani appears and functions in their browsers.

          <h1>Design Style Guide</h1>
          <p>
            After the storyboard was approved, I designed the style guide and
            wireframes to visually align the course with MPI’s brand while
            creating a modern, engaging experience. I used MPI’s style guide as
            a foundation and explored fonts, color palettes, and button styles
            in Figma to craft a clean, consistent design.
          </p>
          <p>
            To represent Ani, I sourced a professional-looking AI character and
            background from Freepik that matched the company’s visual tone. I
            also created interactive elements with clear hover and selected
            states to guide user interaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using wireframes, I mapped out various layout options based on the
            storyboard content. Once the design was finalized, I combined the
            visuals and narration into a PowerPoint prototype, which I then
            built out in Articulate Storyline 360 to add interactivity.

          <h1>Develop Prototype</h1>
          <p>
            I used Articulate Storyline 360 to transform my original PowerPoint
            into an interactive, story-driven learning experience. The prototype
            included core instructional elements, interactive features, and
            realistic scenarios that introduced learners to Ani AI and how to
            use her effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learners began with a title screen, selected an audio preference,
            and were guided by Ani through the course objectives. Key sections
            included an embedded screen share demo and an interactive slide
            where learners could access Ani directly for hands-on practice.
            Smooth transitions and animations helped create an engaging,
            immersive experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            After sharing the prototype with stakeholders, I received helpful
            feedback, mostly positive—which led to small adjustments for
            accuracy and additional animations to boost engagement. Once
            finalized, I moved into full development with a solid, validated
            design.

        <p>
          I developed MPI’s Ani AI Training Course in Articulate Storyline 360,
          transforming static content into a story-driven, interactive
          experience that helps employees integrate Ani into daily workflows. By
          adding realistic scenarios and decision-making opportunities, the
          course filled key training gaps, was well-received by stakeholders,
          and shows strong potential to improve task efficiency and accuracy by
          20%.

            Incorporating additional knowledge checks throughout the learning
